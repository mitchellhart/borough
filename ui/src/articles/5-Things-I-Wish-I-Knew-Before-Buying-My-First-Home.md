I bought my first home less than a year ago and I've been reflecting on the process. Here are 5 things I wish I knew before buying my first home.

## 1. Real estate agents' #1 goal is to make the sale

While many real estate agents are competent professionals, it's important to remember that they work on commission. Because of this, there is a conflict of interest and they may bend the truth or omit facts when it comes to a home's value, its condition, or any number of things to close a deal. Always do your own research and get a second opinion on major decisions.

## 2. Renovations are more difficult than what you see on social media

Tiktoks and instagram reels compress months of hard work into a few minutesâ€”making renovations look easy and fun. They certainly *can* be fun but they certainly aren't easy or cheap. Just getting settled took months and we've yet to take on a big project. Be realistic about what you can accomplish when looking at homes that need a lot of work. Budget extra time and money for unexpected challenges.

## 3. Things will break right away, it's Murphy's law.

This one is painful to admit, but in between our final walk-through and when we got keys, our fridge broke.  Plan for immediate maintenance needs. Many new homeowners face unexpected repairs in the first year. Consider setting aside 1-2% of your home's value annually for maintenance and repairs, and research home warranty options.

## 4. Most of your mortgage payment is pure interest for the first 10 years

This one was pretty shocking to me, but your mortgage heavily favors paying interest on your debt vs. paying down your actual debt. Your first payment is usually around 90% interest and 10% payment towards your debt. Not until around 10 years in will your payment be half interest and half towards your debt. It really made me think differently about the common argument for buying: that buying is essentially like "paying yourself" by investing in an asset you own.

## 5. You have no idea how expensive blinds are, OMG

Window treatments are much more expensive than I anticipated. If your prospective home has good blinds, great! Otherwise budget $200-700 per window for quality blinds or drapes.
