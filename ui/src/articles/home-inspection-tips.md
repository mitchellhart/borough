## Before You Even Call an Inspector

Many first-time buyers don't realize that their own preliminary inspection can be just as valuable as the professional one. Here's what to look for during your initial visits:

### The Basics

Start with the fundamental elements that could signal bigger issues:

- Look up at the ceilings for water stains or uneven paint.
- Check walls for cracks, especially around windows and doors.
- Test every light switch and outlet.
- Run water in all sinks and check under them for leaks.
- Flush all toilets and watch how they refill.
- Open and close all windows and doors.

### Outside the Home

The exterior can tell you a lot about potential problems:

- Walk the perimeter and note any cracks in the foundation.
- Look at how the ground slopes around the house.
- Check gutters and downspouts for proper positioning.
- Observe the roof for missing shingles or unusual sagging.
- Note the age and condition of windows.

## Preparing for the Professional Inspection

Once you're serious about a property, it's time to bring in the professionals. Here's how to make the most of your home inspection:

### Choosing Your Inspector

Don't just go with your agent's recommendation. Research inspectors independently and look for:

- Certifications from recognized organizations.
- Experience in your specific type of home.
- Sample reports they've produced.
- Reviews from previous clients.
- Willingness to answer your questions.

### During the Inspection

Your presence during the inspection is invaluable. Here's how to make the most of it:

#### Take Notes and Photos

- Document everything the inspector points out.
- Take your own photos of concerning areas.
- Write down questions as they come up.

#### Ask These Essential Questions

- What are the most urgent issues you see?
- How old are the major systems (HVAC, water heater, roof)?
- What maintenance will be needed in the next few years?
- Are there any signs of previous repairs?
- What issues should I monitor over time?

## Beyond the Standard Inspection

Sometimes you need additional expertise. Consider these specialized inspections based on the property:

- Sewer scope inspection (especially for homes over 20 years old).
- Radon testing.
- Termite/pest inspection.
- Foundation assessment.
- Electrical system evaluation.
- HVAC specialist review.

## Red Flags That Warrant Further Investigation

### Water-Related Issues

- Musty smells in basements or crawl spaces.
- Water stains on walls or ceilings.
- Mold or mildew anywhere in the house.
- Poor drainage around the foundation.

### Structural Concerns

- Doors that don't close properly.
- Windows that stick or won't stay open.

### System Problems

- Outdated electrical panels.
- Mixed plumbing materials.
- Aging HVAC systems.
- DIY repairs that don't meet code.

### Safety Issues
