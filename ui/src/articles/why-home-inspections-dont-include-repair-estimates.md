This is a seemingly simple question with a quite complex answer, but we'll break it all down here.

## The primary purpose of a home inspection is to uncover the home's condition

While a home's condition seems very closely tied to repairs, it's ultimately a different task to figure out the costs of any issue an inspector finds. There are many different systems in a home, and each can require a different specialist to determine what it would take to bring it to working condition, let alone meet local building codes. Think of it this way - a plumber might be able to tell you the heating isn't working, but you wouldn't necessarily want them to try and fix it.

## Cost estimates can create liability

When someone receives a cost estimate for a repair, they expect to spend roughly that amount to have the issue fixed. If an estimate is not accurate, that inspector or the company where that inspector works may be held liable for their estimate. If a $400 estimate turns into a $10,000 repair after buying a home, the buyer may feel extremely misled and consider seeking legal action.

## Real estate agents often influence what goes into an inspection report

This one is somewhat controversial, but inspectors are often hired or referred by agents, so it's in their best interest to share a report that doesn't frighten away buyers. It's a tricky line to walk for the inspector when their client—the buyer—expects an honest report, but the inspector's next 10 jobs could come from the seller's agent. All of these relationships create massive conflicts of interest and make it clear that finding a trusted third party is an essential part of the home buying experience.

## Inspectors are not allowed to give estimates

The largest trade organizations guiding home inspectors — including the American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI) and the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNACHI) — instruct not to determine causes or estimate methods, materials, and costs of corrections. In some places  home inspectors are legally not allowed to answer questions about the home's value based on its condition, either. Of course, this responsibility shouldn't fall on the inspector, but it leaves buyers in back in a position to make that determination themselves.

## So, what can you do with your inspection report?

The best approach is to consult specialists for each major system to determine accurate repair or replacement costs. Of course, there is rarely time to arrange such an effort. You can research each item from the report and assemble your own rough estimate to see if this property still aligns with your budget. This can be quite time-consuming and often confusing and frustrating. This experience led to the creation of Boro Inspect.
